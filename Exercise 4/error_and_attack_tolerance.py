# The raise command is used to help you out in finding where you still need to

    net: networkx.Graph() object

    Performs an edge removal simulation

    Parameters
    ----------
    orignet: networkx.Graph() object
        Network in which the edge removal is simulated. A copy of orignet is
        created for the simulations, and the original network is not changed.
